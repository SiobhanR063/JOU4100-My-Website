   <h2> The Good, the Bad, and the Coding</h2>
    <div></div>
    <p> Today I've decided to take on the task of  the week 3 module! I have no previous experience with code, but I'm absolutely willing to give it a try. So far so good. Code Academy was very helpful and straightforward. It made me feel fairly confident going into this. The cheatsheets are a great help!</p>
<h2> The Power of Images</h2>
    <img src="boardwalk.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="A wooden boardwalk crosses a bog full of brown reeds">
        <p> This image reminds me of a location near my hometown, Collingwood. There's a lot of local wetlands in residential areas that lead into Georgian Bay. My grandparents actually live very close to an area the locals refer to as "The Boardwalk". It's a very comfortable spot for swans to make their nests and raise their cygnets. It's also a very popular spot for rabbits! During my time living in Collingwood, I must've seen nearly 7 generations of rabbits. </p>

        <p>To be totally honest, professor, I had no idea what to make this website about. Should I make a fake blog? Should I share my interests on the index? No, because that's what our biography is for. Instead of doing that, I decided to focus on class material. But for some fun, here's a list of the things I thought about putting on my first website!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Talk about my summer </li> 
            <li>Talk about music I really like </li>
            <li> Make a fake blog (as previously mentioned)</li>
            <li> Talk about Toronto </li>
            <li> Mention a former journalist I met while working at a hardware store</li>
        </ol>
        <p> I decided to get creative and have some fun with it instead. It's like a long joke. I know I said I wasn't going to talk about music that I like, but I would like a song that's been an "earworm" lately.</p>

    <p> Something else I thought to include in this website that I found kind of funny was a website some of my high school friends showed me. Every time I think of coding, I think of movie scene where there's a professionally hired hacker trying to get government secrets. This website emulates that.</p>

    <p> And if you're interested in me, I've included my biography!</p>
